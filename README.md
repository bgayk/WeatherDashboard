# WeatherDashboard
Provide user local and their queried cities current and 5 day weather forecast. 
Application will save user's cities into local storage for future
 queries. Data will be lost when user clears cash.

The application currently only queries the OpenWeather API and displays the
 results in the console.

Project will be completed and resubmitted shortly (as of 7/26)
